I’m **Bin Duan (段斌)**, Head of Solutions for **Huawei Cloud in Latin America**, currently based in **São Paulo, Brazil**.

My work focuses on helping customers turn cloud capability into measurable outcomes through a pragmatic framework I call **“1 + 3”**:

- **1 = Foundation**: the digital foundation that makes everything else reliable and scalable—unified digital touchpoints (app/web), identity & access, core self-service capabilities, event tracking, and a governed data foundation.
- **3 = Application Modernization + Big Data + AI**: three growth engines that accelerate modernization and performance—modern business applications, scalable data infrastructure and analytics, and AI capabilities (e.g., intelligent customer service, personalization, automation, churn prevention, and decision support).

With this approach, I support organizations across **government, financial services, telecom, and internet** industries in Latin America to adopt Huawei Cloud effectively—building the right foundations first, then accelerating innovation and growth with modernized applications, big data, and AI.

Outside of day-to-day delivery, I’m an active explorer of **frontier AI**: agent workflows, practical automation, and how emerging models can be translated into real enterprise productivity.
